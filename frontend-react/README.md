# About this project

This is an example Red Cross website made by Group 9 in 2nd semester 2022, [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/). 

## Inspiration

Our website is inspired by official Red Cross websites.
- [European Red Cross](https://redcross.eu/)
- [Australian Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org.au/)
- [Red Cross Org](https://www.redcross.org/)

## Main Theme

Health, serious attitude, professionalism, red cross on white background theme. \
Red accents across the page (for example headers), on a white background. Clean squared borders to express a serious attitude.


# Design

## Colors

`--primary-color: #ec361e;`\
`--bakcground-color: #fffefe;`\
`--heading-color: #2f0b06;`\
`--text-color: #191919;`

Our websiteâ€™s color scheme is monochromatic, based on the primary color #ec361e.\
As well as a background color #fffefe to make our cards not blend into the background so much.

## Shadows 

`box-shadow: 2rem 2rem 3rem #e0e0e0;`\
We don't want our shadows to pop out too much, so we chose a light gray shadow color.


## Radiuses

`border-radius: 0.25rem;`\
Since our website is supposed to be very serious and professional, we decided not to use rounded corners, \
we only added some border-radius to make elements look less sharp. \
It was very important for us to keep radiuses and shadows consistent across our entire website, so elements don't look out of place.\

## Fonts
`font-family: Montserrat;`\
Modern sans-serif font. Dark red font for headers to promote the brand, and grey color on chunks of text, grey represents professionalism, formality.\
We have used a modern sans serif font called Montserrat.

## Sizes

`--heading-1-size: 5rem;`\
`--heading-2-size: 3rem;`\
`--text-size: 1rem;`\
`--section-spacing: 10rem;`

## Icon

We only used one icon on our website; the logout button.\
This icon is from the Mui Library, which we also used for the textfields on the login/register page.

## Layout
It was important for our layout to scale well on mobile devices. As well as look good on desktops.\
Here you can see all the sections are aligned properly to eachother, they start and end at the same width.\
The spacing we used between sections is `10rem`.

# Responsive Design

## Sections
All the Sections scale responsivly, not only from desktop to mobile but also inbetween resolutions.

## Mobile Layout

We completley changed the header on mobile resolutions to capture the user attention on the product.\
Our Header and Footer links also get collapsed into hamburger menus.
