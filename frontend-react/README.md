## Intention with the Project

During this project we have created a backend and frontend application for Red Cross Aalesund.

The intention was to create a complex web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with ReactJS), and setting up an REST API we can send requests to, to retrieve data from our database. The intention was to learn how to create complex layouts, with respect to accessibility, responsiveness, and working together in teams to create a complex application that consists of both a frontend-, backend-application, and database. We have managed to create a layout of our homepage which scales nicely from desktop to mobile. We have deployed this solution on a publicly accessible server, at https://gr09.appdev.cloudns.ph .
