Checklist for creating a Design guideline:

Concept phase:
In the concept phase, before writing code, you should decide the general rules an ddirection:
1. Theme: 
   The theme of the design should be professional and serious.

2. Color scheme:
   The company's color scheme are red and white, which we will take into consideration when creating the design. The main colors we will use are red and white,
   as those are the company's color. We will also use grey for chunks of text, as grey gives a professional feeling.
              
3. Hierarchy and layout: 
   The most important thing on the page are the "Buy course" button, which will let the viewer look at different courses we provide, and cart them.
   There will be a header on with the name of the company which will be next in line of importance. The header includes a logo, and some important links,
   like "Products", "Companies", and "Testiomonials". After the header and header content, the products are displayed. Further down the page we have a                                section about the company and reviews. Towards the bottom of the page we have a footer, with a sitemap.
4. Images:
